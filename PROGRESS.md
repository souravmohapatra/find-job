# Progress and continuation

Updated: 2026-10-07.

## Current state

High-level planning and implementation design are documented. The user authorized selecting and recording implementation details and fixed Docker Compose on Ubuntu Server, LAN and local tailnet only, no public access. Subsequent steering requires OpenRouter for all LLM work, independent task models, and model IDs decided later. No application code, installation, build, model run, container startup or remote write has occurred.

## Completed

- Initial product/context baseline and personal-project/local-Git guidance.
- Selected focused app over full platform fork, with public-documentation evidence and limitations.
- Selected React/FastAPI/PostgreSQL/Procrastinate, isolated HTTP/browser collection, OpenRouter per-task routing, ntfy and private Caddy/Tailscale entry points.
- Specified schema concepts, immutable revisions, API contracts, task durability, retries and lifecycle rules.
- Specified CV review, domain diversification, explainable matching and reassessment defaults.
- Specified UI, authentication, secret handling, notifications, backups and acceptance gates.
- Updated earlier high-level-only/deferred decisions to match the latest authorization.
- Incorporated OpenRouter steering across deployment, data model, Settings, budgets, provenance and validation; removed local-model hardware assumptions.

## Latest product refinement

The user supplied Netflix, Spotify, Amazon, Revolut and Airwallex as development-only examples, requested roughly 30% relevance with manual review and exclusion of unrelated primary functions, and selected a configurable daily 19:00 summary. Added supplementary entertainment/finance/corporate/consulting examples with public career entry points. Replaced strict matching/precision gates, made both shortlist categories digest-eligible, and specified timezone/DST/late-assessment behaviour. No app code or runtime work occurred.

## Verification

2026-10-07: checked all 16 Markdown documents, 38 local links, balanced code fences, trailing whitespace and final newlines. Confirmed all three task-model keys are specified, no obsolete Ollama/Qwen selection remains, and no local inference service appears in the deployment. Manually reviewed cross-document scope, privacy, task state, retry and network decisions. No product or runtime acceptance gate has run.

Public official documentation and repository READMEs informed the plan. External pages are references, not proof that our eventual configuration works. Model quality, supported-site coverage, resource estimates and private-network enforcement still need implementation tests.

2026-10-07 refinement check: all 17 Markdown documents and 41 local links passed; code fences, whitespace and final newlines checked. Confirmed the five user-named companies, broad 30-point policy and 19:00 daily digest; stale frequent-digest and strict-precision defaults were removed or explicitly marked superseded. Public career entry points were checked, but no collection or matching runtime was tested.

## Next authorized boundary

The requested design/documentation phase is complete after the final consistency checks. The next product work is implementation milestone 1 in PLAN.md when requested. Do not interpret a technical plan as authorization to install packages, launch infrastructure, or alter the Ubuntu host now.

## Resume notes

Read AGENTS.md, CONTEXT.md, DECISIONS.md and IMPLEMENTATION.md. Exact models are intentionally unset; profile_analysis, job_extraction and job_matching must be configured independently before their LLM tasks run. No local LLM infrastructure is planned. Brave requires a deployment key for automatic company-name discovery; direct URL monitoring can work without it. Domain diversification defaults open but is visibly editable. “All jobs” includes unassessed and rejected jobs. Notification success means ntfy acceptance, not device display. Preserve unknown/partial/error states and no-public-ingress boundaries.

## Development readiness

The current workspace is the development environment. Read-only checks found Ubuntu 24.04, accessible Docker/Compose, Python 3.12 and Node 22, with adequate available memory/disk for the planned containers. No package installation or container build/start was performed.

The user supplied npm's configured package-registry registry. Earlier direct public-registry TLS timeouts bypassed npm configuration and do not prove the configured npm route is broken. Actual package installation through the configured proxy remains unverified; do not silently replace it with the public registry.

Development will use mocked OpenRouter and search responses; the user will provide an OpenRouter key and choose task models for final live validation. A non-empty BRAVE_API_KEY is now present in local .env; only the variable name/presence was checked, never its value in output, and no authenticated request was made. Added .gitignore exclusions for local environment files while retaining placeholder example files.

No additional host package installation is identified as a prerequisite to starting implementation. uv, project dependencies and test browsers will be provisioned in the development/test containers. Tailnet/client notification validation still requires Tailscale and a separate client later.

## Implementation authorization

The user requested implementation, validated phase commits and blocker escalation. Local dependencies, project containers and test execution are now in scope. Mocks remain the default; no live paid requests. Phase 1 is starting with migration/authentication/UI/development infrastructure.
